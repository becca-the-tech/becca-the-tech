### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [Learning Tracker](https://gentle-dawn-40473.herokuapp.com/) and a [Book Tracker](https://infinite-beyond-79502.herokuapp.com/) project.
   I made them using EJS, Express, Node, and MongoDB (currently adding Bootstrap to the Book Tracker). Next steps are to add authentication so others can use the projects and I will probably re-factor to add React to one or both of the projects once I learn more.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've made plants email me when they need watered (with a Raspberry Pi Smart Farm I built).

If any of this intrigues you, check out [my portfolio](https://becca-the-tech.github.io/ReviewPages/portfolio.html) or reach out to my by email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beccathetech). Currently looking for a software engineer job in Tampa, FL or remote opportunities.
